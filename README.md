Choosing your next destination in America can be a daunting task. There are so many places to choose from and each place has its own unique charm. That being said, people have priorities such as cost of living, being around people of similar age and ethnic background, weather, etc. Given these parameters, it can be very difficult to choose the perfect city in America to travel to. Here comes Journey Genie.
